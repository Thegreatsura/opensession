/**
 * Force merge: the agent asks the person driving a session to merge a pull
 * request that GitHub reports as blocked by checks or reviews, and waits
 * while they decide.
 *
 * The agent can only open the card. It names the PR and a reason; the
 * gateway reads the PR's live state and writes everything else on the card
 * itself: the title, the head SHA, the merge method the repository allows,
 * and exactly which checks and reviews the merge would bypass. Only the
 * driver can confirm: the request records the GitHub login of the person who
 * prompted the session, and the route requires that same verified sign-in
 * (machine auth and the no-auth name picker cannot). The merge then runs on
 * the server with the confirmer's own GitHub token, so whether it may bypass
 * branch protection is GitHub's decision about that person; nothing here
 * grants a bypass.
 *
 * The merge is pinned to the head SHA shown on the card. Confirming re-reads
 * the head first and aborts if it moved, and the merge request carries the
 * SHA so GitHub refuses it if the head moves in between.
 *
 * Cancel, an expired card, and a cancelled tool call all close the card
 * without touching GitHub. Every step is audited (kind `pr_force_merge`),
 * and a merged PR gets a short comment saying who confirmed it, why, and
 * what was bypassed.
 *
 * Same shape as credential-registrations.ts: one pending request per
 * session, held in memory, broadcast to every viewer. A restart drops the
 * request and the waiting tool call with it, and nothing is merged.
