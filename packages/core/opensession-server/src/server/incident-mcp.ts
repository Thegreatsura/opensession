/**
 * `opensession-incident` — let an incident responder read the Open Session
 * session that declared its incident.
 *
 * Automations get no session tools: they run on untrusted event text, so
 * reading arbitrary transcripts is out of bounds. This is one narrow exception,
 * mounted only for automations a person opted in (`readIncidentDeclarer`):
 *
 * - it answers only for the incident(s) the run's own triggering event names
 *   (`incidentsInEvent`), never for an id the model supplies from elsewhere;
 * - the incident → session link comes from the server's own record of which
 *   session's `incident_create` succeeded (incident-declarations.ts), not from
 *   the incident summary, which anyone can edit;
 * - it reads that one session: title, link, server-computed evidence (diff,
 *   PR, commands) and its latest assistant messages. No writes, no other ids.
