/**
 * Dreaming: a daily background run per memory repository that reviews recent
 * sessions alongside the existing memory and commits a cleaner memory
 * directly, as Devin's Dreaming does. There is no approval step; every change
 * is a commit that Settings can show and revert.
 *
 * Each repository gets its own automation ("Memory dreaming: <name>"),
 * created by ensureDreamingAutomations. A personal repository's automation is
 * owned by that person. The run sees exactly its repository (a checkout plus
 * the file tools), the changes since its last run, and the sessions active
 * since then, read from the in-memory session list (no per-session database
 * is opened). It may read transcripts through opensession-search.
