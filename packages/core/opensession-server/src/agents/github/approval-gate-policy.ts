/**
 * Approval gate policy: the pure decision behind the "OS approval gate" check
 * (approval-gate.ts posts it). A repository that requires this check in its
 * default-branch ruleset can drop the blanket "one approving review" rule
 * while keeping code-owner review:
 *
 *   - CODEOWNERS (from the default branch) names the human-review paths.
 *     Every changed file with an owner needs an approval from one of that
 *     file's owners, the same rule as GitHub's "require review from Code
 *     Owners", so the two never disagree.
 *   - A PR that touches no owned file passes when the OS review of the
 *     current head is approve, quality 5/5, with no blocking
 *     findings, or when someone with write access approves.
 *   - A PR from a fork, or one touching the review policy or CODEOWNERS
 *     itself, never passes on the model review alone.
 *   - No review of this head yet → in progress (blocks like a running check).
 *   - Anything else → action_required, with the reason in the title.
 *
 * Approvers are humans with write access, never the author or a bot, and a
 * change request from one of them blocks until they approve or it is
 * dismissed. `.os-review.json` always needs a human: its rules can override
 * the review's verdict and scores, and the review reads them from the PR
 * head, so a PR that edits them must not be able to approve itself.
 *
 * Enabled per repository from `.os-review.json` on the default branch, with
 * `"approvalGate": true` or `"approvalGate": { "checkName": "...",
 * "maxRisk": "low" }`. `maxRisk` additionally caps the review's merge risk
 * on the automatic path; without it, risk is shown but does not decide.
 *
 * Human approvals survive later pushes by default, like a ruleset without
 * "dismiss stale reviews on push": the reviewer approved the change, not
 * each commit after it. `"requireApprovalOnHead": true` counts only
 * approvals of the current head. The OS review path always needs a review
 * of the current head.
